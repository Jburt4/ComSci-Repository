IDEAS

Possible fail states - Being torpedoed, engaging a passenger ship, hitting a whale (or your mom), 



Printing to console - Already Have
Accepting command line arguments - Already Have
Getting input from the user - ALready Have (Could add to tho)
Datatypes and casting ()
Logic, including conditionals and if-statements Already Have
Loops Already Have (Should add some)
Defining and using functions - Already Have (Could Add More)
Error checking (try/except) - Need to Add (Needs to work)
Lists (1D and 2D)
Recursive functions (Not going to add)
Image manipulation and display - Game Board?
Strings and string manipulation (ALready have, will add more in order to help error check)
Classes, including constructor, methods, and built-in functions - Different Kinds of Boats

Torpedo "sonar map" Use game board code

Certain chance (around 3%) for our torpedo to miss
	if miss = true, follow up with enemy shooting torpedo, then having small percentage chance of hitting
	(around 5%) then fire back with 100% chance of hitting.

import statment
classes then functions
